<h3>Who Am I. What are my thoughts?<h3>

I can talk to people in a better way when it is one on discussion. If I have adddress a group of people , I loose the confidence, somehow , I loose the connectivity and won't deliver my fullest poetenial.. I am introvert by nature, Would love long and deeep conversations rather then mass gatherings. I can dicuss on things for hours together with 10 people individually,but, if the same 10 people are put in a room and I need to address all of them together , may be I ll deliver for only first 10 mins , then I won't continue, if at all i continue , it won't be the real Me.

I enjoy deep conversations, I think I can understand the person I am talking to , by observing his expressions, body movements and words,and adapt my content delivery to make more fruiteful.I Miss this in group conversations. People have different waavelength , I can match to most of the folks wavelength and mkae it very god dicussion. But, When all people put in a room, I fail to apdapt to mutiple wavelenths at one go and my quality goes down drasatically.
